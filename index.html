    <p><strong>A little about me</strong><br>
      My name is Eunice. I am from the south western part of Nigeria.
      I am currently studying Software Engineering at the Federal University of Technology Akure.
      At the start, the course was an "happen-stance". Then it became a nice cause. And now, it is an interest that's a
      factor in my presence in Altschool.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Me as an AltSchool Student</strong><br>
      As an AltSchool student, it has not been easy. My guess is that it's because I transfered from last cohort. Either
      ways, it has been quite an herculean task following the semester's work. This is because FUTA started and finished
      a whole semester in about 7 months so we had a lot of course work. Catching up with missed lessons on LMS was so
      strenuous.
      Like I haven't received an email for GitHub student pack email yet...
      But I'm going to push through. And the negatives aside, I am looking forward to doing actual cloud learning coming
      semesters. </p>
